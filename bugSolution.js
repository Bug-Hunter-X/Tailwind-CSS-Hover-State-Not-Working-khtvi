```javascript
// Solution 1: Using !important (use cautiously)
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 p-4 important">
  Hover over me!
</div>

// Solution 2: Ensuring no conflicting CSS rules exist (Recommended)
/* Check for conflicting CSS rules in your stylesheets that might override Tailwind's hover styles */

// Solution 3: Check your Tailwind CSS configuration
/* Make sure that your Tailwind configuration file is correctly setup and that the necessary plugins are enabled.  */
