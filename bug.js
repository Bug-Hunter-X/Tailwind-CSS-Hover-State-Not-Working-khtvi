```javascript
// Some Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly.
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 p-4">
  Hover over me!
</div>
```
The above code snippet is expected to change the background color to blue on hover, but it doesn't. This is a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with JavaScript frameworks or when there are conflicts with other CSS rules.
