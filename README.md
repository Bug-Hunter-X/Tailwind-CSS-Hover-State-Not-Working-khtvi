# Tailwind CSS Hover State Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS hover states do not work as expected. The bug occurs due to conflicting CSS rules or issues with JavaScript frameworks.

## Bug Description

A simple div element with Tailwind CSS classes is supposed to change its background color on hover. However, the hover state does not trigger the expected style change. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that no other CSS rules are overriding the Tailwind CSS classes and that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up.  This might involve using `!important` (though this is generally discouraged) or carefully examining the CSS cascade.
